# Digit-Recognizer
This python notebook works through some computer vision with neural network techniques using the classic MNIST data set. It is a basic introduction to convolution neural networks (CNN) and include visualizations of the outputs of the hidden layers for instructive purposes.

The data is the train.csv file from https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data . The pixels are flattened into a single columns which is necessary for most ML applications however CNNs inputs are generally in 3-D.  The original data is found here http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
